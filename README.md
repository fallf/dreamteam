# Eat in Peace 

## User Story 
The user goes out a lot with family and friends.  

They want to know how many calories are best for their specific BMI.  

They want to know where is the best place to eat in a specific area. 

They also want to keep track of the calories they consume on a day-to-day basis base on their BMR

## Purpose
"Eat in Peace" is a web application that gives the user peace of mind when they eat out. In most restaurants, you need a magnifying glass to know the calories an item on the menu has. "Eat in Peace" makes it easy to know how many calories are in an item. Our users will be able to eat without guilt and still be able not to go over their daily  recommended caloric intake. Our motivation as a developer is unable users to eat with peace of mind not worry about how many calories are in the food or what they should consume, or where to go.
